        <h2>About Mosque.</h2>
        <p>A mosque (Masjid) is a place of worship for Muslims, where they gather for prayers, learning, and community activities. The word "Masjid" comes from Arabic, meaning "place of prostration." Mosques hold great significance in Islam, as they serve as centers for spiritual growth and unity among Muslims. The first mosque in Islam is the Kaaba in Mecca, which is considered the holiest site. Another important mosque is Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina, built by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in 622 CE, which became a model for future mosques. Over time, mosques have spread across the world, adopting different architectural styles while maintaining key Islamic elements. Most mosques feature a prayer hall, a mihrab (a niche indicating the direction of Mecca), a minaret (a tower from which the call to prayer is announced), and an open courtyard. Some also include madrasas (Islamic schools) for education. Mosques play a vital role in Muslim communities, providing a space for worship, social gatherings, and charity activities.</p>
